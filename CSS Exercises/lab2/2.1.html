  <p>The SETU Carlow Campus Medical Center is Nurse led and available to all full-time registered students and apprentices throughout the academic year.
The service is provided as a term time addition rather than a replacement for the student's own GP and intended
to provide acute care during the week when it is not possible for students to attend their own Medical Practice.
The service provides treatment and referrals to community services, and promotes positive well-being through advice,
information and health promotion. The College Nurse Theresa Lowry-Lehnen is available for the assessment,
treatment and management of students' health needs during the term and for the management of any illness or condition
    that requires special attention during college hours.</p>
