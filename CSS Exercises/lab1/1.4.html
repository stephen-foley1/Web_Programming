<p2>1)	Instagram
  a)	I think Instagram is designed to be to be used on average daily for around 2 hours. I personally use it for about 30 minutes when I am travelling just to see what people have posted to keep me away from boredom.
  b)	It is designed to send notifications as much as possible.
  c)	The notifications are on by default, more can be enabled such as receiving more notifications from people.
  d)	The notifications you receive from Instagram are from comments (someone comments on your post), likes (if someone likes your post), messages (if someone messages you), these are by default. You can enable notifications for people to get a notification if they post or go live.
  e)	Users might feel the urge to respond to a notification if it was a message from someone, they might feel the urge if someone such as an idol or celebrity they follow post and they get a notification that they posted. Notifications such as someone liked your post would be easily ignorable. It would be hard to avoid a message from someone.
  f)	The only important notification could be receiving a message from someone that might need an urgent reply. Other notifications are more of a view action than a response action and you can click it later and it would not made a difference if you clicked it earlier.
  g)	The notifications are more hedonic than utilitarian because they notify you of something new that has happened somewhere.
