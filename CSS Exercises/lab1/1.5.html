    <span class="important">SETU Carlow Campus Student Service</span>
  <p>The aim of Student Services is to provide a comprehensive and caring service to help our students to achieve their full academic
    and personal potential. The key to success for these services is that people find them easy to access and are not afraid to ask questions!</p>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="important">SETU Carlow Campus Medical Center</span>
    The SETU Carlow Campus Medical Center is Nurse led and available to all full-time registered students and apprentices throughout the academic year.
    The service is provided as a term time addition rather than a replacement for the student's own GP and intended
    to provide acute care during the week when it is not possible for students to attend their own Medical Practice.
    The service provides treatment and referrals to community services, and promotes positive well-being through advice,
    information and health promotion. The College Nurse Theresa Lowry-Lehnen is available for the assessment,
    treatment and management of students' health needs during the term and for the management of any illness or condition
    that requires special attention during college hours.
    <span class="important">Medical records are private and confidential and are not part of the main SETU records</span>
